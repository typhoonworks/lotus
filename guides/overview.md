# Overview

Lotus is a lightweight library that provides safe, read-only SQL query execution and management for Elixir applications using Ecto. It's designed to help you organize and execute analytical queries while maintaining strict safety controls.

## Why Lotus?

Modern applications often need to run complex analytical queries for reporting, business intelligence, or data exploration. However, executing arbitrary SQL in production environments comes with significant risks:

- **Security concerns**: Unrestricted SQL access can lead to data breaches or accidental damage
- **Performance issues**: Poorly written queries can impact application performance
- **Organization challenges**: Ad-hoc queries scattered across codebases are hard to maintain
- **Reusability problems**: Useful queries get lost or duplicated

Lotus addresses these challenges by providing:

## Key Benefits

### üîê Safety First
- **Read-only execution**: Built-in protections prevent destructive operations
- **Statement validation**: Queries are checked before execution
- **Database-level guards**: PostgreSQL (`transaction_read_only`), MySQL (`transaction_read_only`), and SQLite 3.8.0+ (`PRAGMA query_only`)
- **Session state preservation**: Automatically snapshots and restores original database session settings to prevent connection pool pollution
- **Table visibility controls**: Configurable rules block access to sensitive tables
- **Multi-layered security**: Defense-in-depth with preflight authorization
- **Timeout controls**: Configurable timeouts prevent runaway queries

### üì¶ Organized Storage
- **Persistent queries**: Save and organize your SQL queries
- **Version control friendly**: Queries are stored in your database, not scattered in code
- **Easy retrieval**: Simple API to find and execute saved queries

### üèóÔ∏è Framework Agnostic
- **Ecto integration**: Works with any Ecto-based application
- **Multi-database support**: Supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite simultaneously
- **Flexible architecture**: Separate storage and execution repositories
- **Minimal dependencies**: Lightweight with few external requirements

### ‚ö° Developer Friendly
- **Simple API**: Intuitive functions for creating and running queries
- **Type safety**: Structured results with proper error handling
- **Configuration**: Flexible setup to match your application's needs
- **Schema introspection**: Discover tables, inspect schemas, and gather statistics

## Core Concepts

### Queries
A query in Lotus is a saved SQL statement with metadata like name and creation time. Queries are stored in your database and can be executed repeatedly.

### Execution
All SQL execution happens through Lotus's runner, which enforces read-only restrictions and provides consistent error handling and timeout management.

### Results
Query results are returned in a structured format (`QueryResult`) that includes the data and column information.

### Schema Introspection
Lotus provides comprehensive schema discovery tools to explore database structure, list tables across schemas, inspect column definitions, and gather table statistics.

## Use Cases

Lotus is perfect for:

- **Reporting dashboards**: Execute saved queries to generate reports
- **Data exploration**: Safely allow analysts to run custom queries
- **Business intelligence**: Organize and execute analytical queries
- **Metrics collection**: Store and run queries for application metrics
- **Data exports**: Generate data extracts with saved, tested queries
- **Database administration**: Explore table structures and gather statistics
- **Multi-tenant applications**: Manage schema-per-tenant architectures
