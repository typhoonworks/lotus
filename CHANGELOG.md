# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **NEW:** `read_only: false` option for `run_sql` — disables the application-level deny list, allowing write queries (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DDL). Single-statement validation and visibility rules still apply.
- **NEW:** AI-generated query variable configurations alongside SQL
  - LLM can now produce `{{variable}}` placeholders with full variable metadata (type, widget, label, default, list, static_options, options_query)
  - System prompt teaches the LLM when and how to generate variables (only on explicit user request, never proactively)
  - Smart options strategy: `static_options` via `get_column_values()` for small cardinality, `options_query` for dynamic/large sets
  - `extract_variables/1` parser for ```` ```variables ```` JSON blocks with normalization (type validation, widget/list defaults, nil stripping)
  - `extract_response/1` unified extractor combining SQL and variable extraction for providers
  - All providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) return `variables` in their response map
  - `generate_query/1` and `generate_query_with_context/1` now include `variables` in the result
  - Conversation history preserves and formats variable context across multi-turn exchanges

### Changed

- `Lotus.AI.Provider.response` type now includes a `variables` field
- `Conversation.add_assistant_response/4` accepts an optional `variables` parameter (defaults to `[]`)
- Providers use `SQLGeneration.extract_response/1` instead of `extract_sql/1` for response parsing

## [0.14.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added

- **NEW:** List variable support for multi-value query parameters (e.g., `IN (...)` clauses)
  - Variables with `list: true` expand to multiple SQL placeholders at execution time
  - Correct parameter index sequencing when mixing list and scalar variables
  - Per-element type casting for list values (e.g., `:number` casts each element individually)
  - Automatic normalization of comma-separated strings into lists (e.g., `"US, UK, DE"` → `["US", "UK", "DE"]`)
  - Support for all database adapters (PostgreSQL `$1, $2, $3`, MySQL/SQLite `?, ?, ?`)
  - Validation that list variables contain at least one value
  - Added `list` boolean field to `QueryVariable` schema (defaults to `false`)

## [0.13.0] - 2026-02-10

### Added

- **NEW:** Long-running conversation support for AI-powered query generation
  - Multi-turn conversations with context retention across messages
  - Conversational refinement of generated queries based on user feedback
  - Enhanced error detection and query optimization capabilities
  - Support for iterative query improvements without starting from scratch
  - Replaces previous "fire and forget" single-request model with stateful conversations

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** Minimum Elixir version bumped from 1.16 to 1.17 (required by `langchain` dependency)

## [0.12.0] - 2026-02-10

### Added

- **NEW (EXPERIMENTAL):** AI-powered SQL query generation from natural language
  - Support for OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-4o), Anthropic (Claude), and Google Gemini models

  - Four introspection tools: `list_schemas()`, `list_tables()`, `get_table_schema()`, `get_column_values()`
  - Provider-agnostic architecture with shared tool implementations
  - Disabled by default - requires explicit configuration
  - See "AI Query Generation" section in README for setup instructions

### Changed

- Added `langchain` as a required dependency (needed for AI features)

- Added "cast only when needed" optimization - text and enum types pass through without casting
- Added comprehensive logging for type detection failures (debug/warning levels)
- Added support for schema-qualified table names in automatic type detection (e.g., `public.users`)
- Added custom type handler validation to ensure handlers implement required callbacks

### Changed

- Enhanced query variable system to automatically detect column types from database schema

#### Data Migration Required

If you have existing queries stored in your database with `static_options` in the old format, you will need to migrate them. See the [Migration Guide in README.md](README.md#upgrading-from-versions--090) for detailed instructions and migration script.

## [0.9.0] - 2025-09-03

- **INTERNAL:** Moved all database-specific schema operations (`list_tables`, `get_table_schema`, `resolve_table_schema`) from `Lotus.Schema` to respective source modules for better separation of concerns
- **INTERNAL:** `Lotus.Schema` is now completely database-agnostic and delegates all DB-specific operations to source modules
- **PERFORMANCE:** Added caching to `resolve_table_schema` queries to eliminate the expensive "which schema is this table in?" database lookups that were being repeatedly executed

### Fixed
- Fixed schema introspection for SQLite databases by properly handling schema-less database architecture (empty schemas list instead of `["public"]`)

## [0.6.0] - 2025-08-31

### Added
- Added `Lotus.can_run?/1` and `Lotus.can_run?/2` functions to check if a query has all required variables available before execution
- Added `Lotus.SQL.Transformer` for transforming SQL queries to ensure database-specific syntax compatibility when using lotus variables
- Added `Lotus.SourceUtils` module providing utility functions for detecting data source types and feature support across adapters
- Added comprehensive interval query transformation support for PostgreSQL (INTERVAL syntax, make_interval functions)
- Added quoted wildcard pattern transformation for database-specific string concatenation (supports both PostgreSQL || and MySQL CONCAT)
- Added quoted variable placeholder stripping for cleaner parameter binding

### Enhanced
- Enhanced query execution to automatically transform SQL statements based on target database adapter before parameter binding

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL:** Fixed database session persistence issue where session-level settings (`PRAGMA query_only` for SQLite, `SET SESSION TRANSACTION READ ONLY` and `max_execution_time` for MySQL) were not being properly restored after query execution, causing connection pool pollution that could break subsequent operations. Lotus now uses a robust snapshot/restore pattern to preserve and restore original session state for each database connection.

## [0.5.4] - 2025-08-29

### Fixed
- Fixed incomplete `@type opts()` specification - added missing `:repo` and `:vars` options to eliminate Dialyzer type errors

## [0.5.2] - 2025-08-28

### Enhanced
- Enhanced `Lotus.run_query/2` variable resolution to properly merge default variable values with runtime overrides via `vars` option

### Fixed
- Removed non-functional identifier variable substitution (e.g., `{{table}}` for table names) that would cause Ecto adapter crashes
- Clarified documentation that variables are only safe for SQL values (WHERE clauses, ORDER BY values), never for identifiers like table or column names

## [0.5.1] - 2025-08-27

### Fixed
- Fixed error handling for optional Ecto adapters - removed hardcoded references to specific adapter error structs (`Postgrex.Error`, `MyXQL.Error`, `Exqlite.Error`) to prevent compilation crashes when those adapters are not installed in host applications
- Added MySQL preflight authorization support with intelligent alias resolution and schema-qualified table parsing

### Changed
- Refactored adapter error formatting to use dynamic error type checking instead of pattern matching on specific error structs

## [0.5.0] - 2025-08-26

### Added
- Database-level read-only protection for SQLite using `PRAGMA query_only` (SQLite 3.8.0+)
- Comprehensive CTE (Common Table Expression) destructive operation tests for both PostgreSQL and SQLite

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Replaced `var_defaults` field with structured `variables` field for enhanced UI integration
- **BREAKING:** Changed variable placeholder syntax from `{var}` to `{{var}}` for better parsing
- **BREAKING:** Database schema migration removes `var_defaults` column and adds `variables` column to `lotus_queries` table

- Added `options_query` field for dynamic dropdown population from database queries
- Added validation to ensure select widgets define either `static_options` or `options_query`

## [0.3.3] - 2025-08-25

### Changed
- Improved table visibility rules: bare string patterns (e.g., `"api_keys"`) now match table names across all schemas in PostgreSQL, not just nil/empty schemas. This provides a more intuitive API where `"api_keys"` blocks the table in any schema, while `{"public", "api_keys"}` blocks it only in the public schema.

## [0.3.2] - 2025-08-25

- Change `statement` col from varchar to text

- Add `get_query` to fetch queries without raising when they don't exist

## [0.2.0] - 2025-08-21
